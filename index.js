/*Task 1: counterMaker()
  
  Study the code for counter1 and counter2, then answer the questions below.
  
  1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?

  counter 1 has block/function level scopes and variables (i.e. the variable count and the function counter()) where as counter2 has global level scope, functions and variables (i.e. all the code - the variable "count", function " counter2()")

  2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?

  counter1 is definitely a closure as it has function inside a function calling a variable in the function outside of it where it is nested. What is happening is, the function "counter()" is calling the variable "count" which is inside the function "countermaker()" but outside itself (i.e. fucntion "counter()").

  3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would 
     counter2 be better?  

counter1 code is preferrable when you want to have secret variables and/or just want to have less problems when writing multiple lines of codes because you won't have any of the components of the block level scope (ie the variables and functions inside the global function -- in this case function "countermaker()").
counter2 code is preferrable when you do want to have that code available through the entirety of the window or your program so that other functions, devs or user can call those functions and variables you declared in that global scope

*/

// counter1 code
function counterMaker() {
  let count = 0;
  return function counter() {
   return count++;
  }
}

const counter1 = counterMaker();

// counter2 code

/* ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è Task 2: inning() ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è
Use the inning function below to do the following:
  1. Return a random whole number of points between 0 and 2 scored by one team in an inning
  
  For example: invoking inning() should return a numerical score value of 0, 1, or 2
  
NOTE: This will be a callback function for the tasks below

/* ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è Task 3: finalScore() ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è
Use the finalScore function below to do the following:
  1. Receive the callback function `inning` that was created in Task 2 
  2. Receive a number of innings to be played
  3. After each inning, update the score of the home and away teams
  4. After the last inning, return an object containing the final (total) score of the innings played
  
  For example: invoking finalScore(inning, 9) might return this object:
{
  "Home": 11,
  "Away": 5
}

Use the getInningScore() function below to do the following:
  1. Receive a callback function - you will pass in the inning function from task 2 as your argument 
  2. Return an object with a score for home and a score for away that populates from invoking the inning callback function */

/* ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è Task 5: scoreboard() ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è
Use the scoreboard function below to do the following:
  1. Receive the callback function `getInningScore` from Task 4
  2. Receive the callback function `inning` from Task 2
  3. Receive a number of innings to be played
  4. Return an array where each of it's index values equals a string stating the
  Home and Away team's scores for each inning.  Not the cummulative score.
  5. If there's a tie at the end of the innings, add this message containing the score to the end of the array:  "This game will require extra innings: Away 12 - Home 12"  (see tie example below)
     If there isn't a tie, add this message to the end of the array: "Final Score: Away 13 - Home 11"  (see no tie example below)
  
  NO TIE example: invoking scoreboard(getInningScore,inning, 9) might return 
  an array of strings like this:
[
  "Inning 1: Away 1 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 2: Away 2 - Home 1",
  "Inning 3: Away 0 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 4: Away 2 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 5: Away 2 - Home 0", 
  "Inning 6: Away 1 - Home 1", 
  "Inning 7: Away 0 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 8: Away 2 - Home 2",
  "Inning 9: Away 1 - Home 0", 
  "Final Score: Away 11 - Home 12"

  TIE example: invoking scoreboard(getInningScore,inning, 9) might return 
  an array of strings like this:
[
  "Inning 1: Away 1 - Home 1", 
  "Inning 2: Away 2 - Home 2",
